# SA singlefocal

## 1

**should be more**

axis of 0

cylinder of 0 to -0.5

## 2

**should be some more (unsuccessful searches)**

cylinders of -3 to -4 (axis around 170 to 0 to 10)



## 3:

**already enough in inv**

positive spheres

## 4: 

the rest, looks good


# SM singlefocal

## 1:

**too many in inv**

spheres that are -3 to -8

## 2:

**should be more**

at least one eye that has cylinder and axis of 0 (also both eyes for both eyes 0s)

spheres of +1 to -2

## 3: 

**missing some (unsuccessful matches)**

cylinder of -3 to -4 in at least one eye, varying sphere, axis close to 0

## 4: 

**more than enough in inv**

cylinder of 0 to -2 and axis of 20 to 140 in at least one eye

## 5:

- we are good with glasses were the axis is middle (50-120) (and at least one cylinder > 0). rather less of them needed, expect for higher sphere values > 3 some unsuccessful
- we need more with spheres of -0.5 to -2.5 (mostly -0.75 to -2)
