# sa single

_more imprecise predication due to smaller sample size_

we need

- much more of zero-ish axis (from 160 to 0 to 20) with a any sphere 
  - also some more of this with at least one eye sphere of 0 specifically

we have

- enough with axis not zero-ish (so 50 to 120) (and at least one cylinder > 0). rather less of them needed, expect for higher sphere values > 3 some unsuccessful
  - expect for 0 sphere glasses, some are needed
- we need more with spheres of -0.5 to -2.5 (mostly -0.75 to -2)

## sm single

_more imprecise predication due to smaller sample size_

we need

- more with a zero-ish axis 
  - a lot more with a sphere of -1.5 to +1.5, 
  - especially with sphere of 0 (in one eye)
  - and with any negative sphere and 0 to -0.5 cylinder
- tiny amount more of glasses with high cylinders (-1 to -4) and 160 to 0 to 20 axis

we have

- more than enough of axis around 90-ish (i.e. not close to 0 axis)


## sa multi

we need

- more with with any positive spheres and 0-ish axis / zero cylinder. 
  - rather with higher add (i.e. bigger than 2.5) than lower (less than 2), but also some of the latter

we have

- more than enough of 90ish axis (like 70-110) (and therefore non null cylinders), 
  - especially for spheres higher than +1.25




# sm multi

we need

- muuuuch more with close to 0 axis and 0 to -0.75 cylinder, any positive spheres
- some more of glasses with a smaller add value, i.e. -1 to -1.75 (and an axis that is **not** around 90ish)

we have

- more than enough of spheres bigger than +1.5 and non-zero cylinders
- enough of spheres bigger than 0 and non-zero cylinders
